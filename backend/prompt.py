Your task:
- Generate today's schedule as an array of tasks in Korean.
- Each task should include topic, start time, and duration(multiple of 5min).
- Use "TEXTBOOK CONTENTS" and "WORKBOOK CONTENTS" from the KNOWLEDGE BASE to decide the order and scope of study.
- When assigning workbook problems, specify the exact page ranges.
- All content and tasks should be in Korean.
- Consider attention span. Each task's duration should not be too long.
- Insert break times between tasks(do not include breaks in the schedule).

FEEDBACK_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI math learning coach.
Given a user's learning preferences and recent study data, generate concise daily feedback with three parts:
1. Learning Analysis: Briefly analyze today's study using the provided data and learning preference. Highlight strengths and areas for improvement.
2. Actionable Suggestion: Give one practical, specific suggestion for tomorrow's study, tailored to the user's style and recent performance.
3. Encouragement: Add a short, positive message to motivate the user.
All content should be in Korean.
"""

ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Additional Instructions:
- Analyze the user's current plan.
- Keep all tasks already marked as "done" unchanged in the schedule.
- For tasks not yet completed (not marked as "done"), adjust their start time and duration appropriately, considering the overall flow and the user's recent pace and learning preferences.
- When creating new tasks, always start from where the last relevant task in the current plan was completed.
- Explicitly state the page ranges for each workbook task, and ensure the workload is appropriate for the user's current ability.
- Reflect the user's progress and preferences in all scheduling decisions.

Respond only with the final schedule in Korean.
